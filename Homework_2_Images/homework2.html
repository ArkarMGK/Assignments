    <h1>Homemade Chicken Nuggets Recipe </h1>

    <p>
        Chicken nuggets are very easy to make with a few ingredients and are available in most fast food restaurants. They look yummy and taste so great. My favorite is spicy one with ketchup.

            Place the flour in a resealable plastic bag and season with the garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper . Place the chicken pieces in the bag with the flour and toss to coat (work in batches). Transfer the breadcrumbs to a rimmed plate, season with salt and pepper and set aside 🥰.

            Whisk the egg and 1 tablespoon water in a medium bowl. Remove a piece of chicken from the flour, dip in the egg mixture, then the breadcrumbs, gently pressing the crumbs into the chicken, and set on a clean plate. Repeat with the remaining pieces of chicken 👌.

            Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat 🔥. Add the chicken pieces to the pan (work in batches if needed) and brown on each side, about 8 minutes total ⏲️. Use a spatula to transfer the chicken nuggets to a paper-towel-lined plate 🍽️. Salt while hot and serve 😋😋.
